## Fast Flow

Fast Flow is a new way to create flow charts using only your keyboard.

Create Mode allows you to create nodes and add labels to them. Following actions are available in this Mode:

- s - Add a box below
- w - Add a box above
- a - Add a box to the left

Create Mode automatically selects all newly created box for you to enter the label. Type the label name, and press Enter when you are done. You can toggle between the two modes by pressing the Esc key.

Following actions are available in the Edit Mode:

- Tab - Toggle between the boxes
- Enter - Edit the label of a box

Once you are done editing the label of a box, you can press Enter to confirm.
